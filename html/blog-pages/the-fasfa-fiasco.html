        <h1>The FASFA Fiasco</h1>
        <img src="../../img/katie-moum-o0kbc907i20-unsplash.jpg" alt="Article Photo">
        <p>With the series of delays and chaos caused by the introduction of the new FASFA system for the 2024 application season, students were left in a limbo not knowing whether or not they qualified for sufficient financial aid. This rocky start has been particularly stressful for families amidst the already stressful college application process.</p>
        <h2>What is the new FASFA?</h2>
        <p>The new Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) was meant to streamline the process of applying for federal aid for families across the country. However, the introduction of the system was marked by a series of glitches and delays, leaving many students in a limbo.</p>
        <h2>Understanding the FASFA Meltdown</h2>
        <p>In the Department of Educationâ€™s ambition overhaul of the FASFA system, several technical glitches and calculation errors plagued the roll out. A large tax error, for example, caused many applications to be delayed for months as engineers attempted to fix the issue. This problem was twofold, as fewer completed applications caused colleges to struggle to issue financial aid awards to students that needed it.</p>
        <h2>Who is to blame?</h2>
        <p>The finger-pointing game ensues as stakeholders seek answers for the FAFSA debacle. The Biden administration faces scrutiny for its handling of the overhaul, with some critics arguing that a focus on student loan forgiveness initiatives overshadowed the importance of a smooth FAFSA transition. Meanwhile, Congress's deadlines and funding constraints further complicate the situation.</p>
