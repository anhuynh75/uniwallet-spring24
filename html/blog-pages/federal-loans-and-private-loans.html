        <h1>Federal and Private Student Loans</h1>
        <img src="../../img/alexander-mils-lCPhGxs7pww-unsplash.jpg" alt="Article Photo">
        <p>As students head into what is quite possibly the most pivotal times of their lives in college, they are faced with the ever impending question that will be constant in the back of their minds: How will I pay for college?</p>
        <p>There are several attractive options out there, but this article will explain to you what to look out for when comparing Federal with Private student loans.</p>
        <p>As a rule of thumb, stick to Federal student loans and use private student loans as a last resort. Federal loans usually have much better terms.</p>
        <h2>What are Federal Student Loans?</h2>
        <p>As the name suggests, these loans are provided by the Federal government (The US Department of Education) to help students cover the cost of their education. They provide several benefits and protections for their borrowers that are not present within private student loans. Federal loans have deferment options, loan forgiveness, and fixed rates. To apply for these loans, students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FASFA) every year which will determine their eligibility for financial aid.</p>
        <p>There are several types of student loans.</p>
        <h3>Direct Subsidized Loans</h3>
        <p>These loans are meant for undergraduate students who have demonstrated financial need. The interest on these loans are paid off by the government for students who are enrolled in college for at least half-time.</p>
        <h3>Direct Unsubsidized Loans</h3>
        <p>Unlike subsidized loans, students are responsible for paying off the interest that accrued during their time in college. These loans are available to both undergraduate and graduate students, regardless of financial need.</p>
        <h3>Direct PLUS Loans</h3>
        <p>Available to graduate, professional, and parents of dependent undergraduate students, these loans are meant to help cover any additional expenses that a student may accrue that may not be covered by other types of financial aid. These loans, unlike the other loans, require a credit check and are usually marked by a higher interest rate.</p>
        <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
        <h3>Benefits:</h3>
        <h4>Fixed interest rates</h4>
        <p>Federal loans offer fixed interest rates that do not change based on market conditions. This allows students to have a stable and predictable payment plan.</p>
        <h4>Loan Forgiveness</h4>
        <p>Students may be eligible for loan forgiveness under specific circumstances. Programs such as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and the Total Permanent Disability discharge offers options for students who are burdened by loans to be relieved.</p>
        <h4>Income-Driven Repayment</h4>
        <p>Federal loans can offer plans that can be changed depending on the student’s income levels. These plans can take only a percentage of the student’s income, allowing them to be much more manageable and bearable to students in the long-run.</p>
        <h3>Detriments</h3>
        <h4>Loan Limits</h4>
        <p>Federal loans are usually not enough to cover a student's financial need in college. A lot of the time, students need to find other methods to cover their finances such as finding part-time work or pulling out more loans.</p>
        <h4>Eligibility</h4>
        <p>Federal loans usually require stringent financial eligibility requirements. Students who complete the FAFSA may not qualify for all of the financial assistance that they need.</p>
        <h2>What Are Private Student Loans?</h2>
        <p>Provided by banks, credit unions, and other institutions, these loans are meant specifically for students to pay for their higher education. They come with multiple options for the student to pay off their loan, depending on their situation and preferences.</p>
        <p>Compared to Federal loans, these loans usually have a variable interest rate which can change depending on the market and are usually much stricter when it comes to deferment options. These loans also typically require a credit check and a cosigner.</p>
        <h2>Private Student Loans</h2>
        <h3>Benefits:</h3>
        <h4>Loan Amounts</h4>
        <p>Private student loans usually allow students to borrow up to their total cost of attendance. This can allow students to cover any gaps left in their financial aid that weren’t covered by Federal aid options</p>
        <h4>Customized Terms and Conditions</h4>
        <p>Students can customize their loan terms to their liking including variable interest rates, repayment plans, and possible deferment options.</p>
        <h3>Detriments:</h3>
        <h4>Variable Interest Rates</h4>
        <p>Variable interest rates are directly tied to market fluctuations which may introduce a level of uncertainty and potentially higher borrowing costs than initially expected. This can be especially stressful for students if interest rates rise significantly.</p>
        <h4>Credit Requirements</h4>
        <p>Private student loans usually require some form of credit history or line before loans are given out. Borrowers with limited credit may struggle to qualify for these loans without a cosigner.</p>
        <h4>Lack of Federal Protections</h4>
        <p>Private student loans lack many of the protections that are granted to Federal borrowers such as loan forgiveness, deferment, and income-driven options. These make borrowers much more vulnerable to market conditions and financial hardships.</p>
